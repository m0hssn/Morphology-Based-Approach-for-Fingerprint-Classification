# Fingerprint Classification using HOG Features
This project uses the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor to classify fingerprint images. The HOG features are extracted from the preprocessed fingerprint images and are used to train a classifier. The classifier is then used to classify new fingerprint images.
